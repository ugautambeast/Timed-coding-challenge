Timed Coding Quiz Challenge
--- Overview
Creating a timed coding quiz along with a highscore section. A penalty for the incorrect answer will be deducted by 5 seconds.

Challenge
A company has given me a objective to demonstrate my skills by creating a quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

My Process/### What I learned
I have watched YouTube tutorials on how to use Javascript so I am able to create the coding quiz. I have also purchased 2 books, "HTML & CSS" and "Javascript & Jquery" by Jon Duckett. These 2 books have really helped me deeply understand the fundamentals of Javascript to create this coding quiz. 

Built with
HTML, advanced CSS, script.js
